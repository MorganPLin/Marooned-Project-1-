Repository for Project 1

Hello, and welcome to Marooned!

You and a fellow player have been dropped off on a forsaken island in the middle of the ocean. You must build a ship to sail away. But first, you must collect supplies!

TURNS:

1) Players take turns by rolling a dice (1-6).

2) Player A moves using the arrow keys; Player B moves using keys W(up), S(down), A(left), D(right).

2) Players may only move the number of spaces generated by the dice . Attempting to move onto water without will result in loss of 1 move! Additionally, your character will not move.


HOW TO PLAY:

  1) Marooned is divided into land and water sections.

  2) Coins icons are located in water; wood icons are located on land. Players may only travel on water once they have built a raft (Collect Wood icons x 2).

  3) To win, players must reach a trading post with 2 Coin icons, with which they may trade for a sail cloth to finish building their boat, and sail away from the island!

Press the reset button at any time to restart the game and rearrange the icons.
